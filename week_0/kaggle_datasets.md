    - Openness
    - Conscientiousness
    - Extraversion
    - Agreeableness
    - Neuroticism
  - Numerical aptitude:- This is often evaluated through assessments or tests, plays a crucial role in career prediction models. This skill indicates an individual's proficiency in understanding and working with numbers, which is essential in various professions such as finance, engineering, data analysis, and scientific research. High numerical aptitude scores may suggest suitability for roles requiring quantitative analysis, problem-solving, and decision-making based on numerical data. Conversely, lower scores may indicate a better fit for roles that rely less on numerical reasoning. However, it's important to consider other factors alongside numerical aptitude, such as interests, personality traits, and additional skills, for accurate career predictions.
  - Spatial aptitude :- It refers to an individual's ability to mentally manipulate shapes, visualize objects in different orientations, and understand spatial relationships. In terms of career prediction, individuals with high spatial aptitude often excel in professions that involve tasks such as architecture, engineering, graphic design, geographic information systems (GIS), and various fields of science and technology. Their ability to perceive and understand spatial relationships allows them to thrive in roles that require problem-solving, creativity, and the ability to interpret and design visual representations of data or structures.
  - Perceptual Aptitude :- In career prediction refers to an individual's ability to accurately perceive and interpret information in their chosen field or occupation. It encompasses skills such as pattern recognition, attention to detail, spatial reasoning, and problem-solving. A high perceptual aptitude often correlates with success in careers that require keen observation, critical thinking, and quick decision-making, such as graphic design, engineering, medicine, or law enforcement.
  - Abstract reasoning :- It is a cognitive ability that involves the understanding and manipulation of complex ideas and concepts, often without the need for concrete or tangible information. In the context of career prediction, abstract reasoning skills can be crucial indicators of an individual's potential success in certain fields.Candidates with strong abstract reasoning abilities tend to excel in roles that require problem-solving, critical thinking, and the ability to analyze and interpret complex data or situations. These skills are highly valued in professions such as engineering, computer science, research, and strategic planning.
  - Verbal reasoning:- It tests are assessments commonly used in career prediction and selection processes. They evaluate an individual's ability to comprehend and analyze written information, draw logical conclusions, and solve problems based on textual data. These tests are particularly relevant in fields that require strong communication, critical thinking, and decision-making skills, such as management, law, journalism, and consulting. A high score in verbal reasoning suggests that an individual possesses the aptitude to effectively process and interpret written information, which can be indicative of success in professions that demand strong verbal communication and analytical abilities.
- We can use the random forest algorithm for the carrer prediction as it gives us 81.25% accuracy.
